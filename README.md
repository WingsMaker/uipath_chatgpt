Below demo shows that the main workflow in UiPath is going to be very simple due to this.

Where to get this library ? Just download from this github page.

Here is the workflow of the library, the main language in used for code is VB ( visual basic ).

What other files do I need to create?

Create an excel file called "bot_config.xlsx" with API key stored inside. The main workflow calls Excel library to get the API key.

I am a C# developer, not familiar with VB language. Any similar post for this ?
